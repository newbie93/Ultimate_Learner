 *    add_two_numbers_rep_by_lists_create_third_list.c
 *
 *    Here 2 integers are represented as linked lists, where each node carries 1 digit of the numbers.
 *    eg. 100 is represented as: head -> 1 -> 0 -> 0 -> NULL & 200 : head -> 2 -> 0 -> 0 -> NULL
 *    Our task is to add the two numbers and create a third number, represented as list.
 *
 *    eg. 931 + 32 = 962 : head-> 9 -> 3 -> 1 -> NULL + head -> 3 ->2 -> NULL = head -> 9 -> 3 -> 6 -> NULL
 *    eg. 999 + 1 = 1000: head-> 9 -> 9 -> 9 -> NULL + head -> 1 -> NULL = head -> 1 -> 0 -> 0 -> 0 -> NULL
